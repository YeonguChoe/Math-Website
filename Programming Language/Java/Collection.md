# Collection

```java

```

- Collections framework provides a number of libraries, including classes and interfaces, that can help simplify working with data.
- Arrays have a fixed size and cannot be resized. When creating an array, you need to specify its size, and if you want to add or remove items, you'll need to create a new array.
- Collections, on the other hand, offer the benefit of flexibility in size. You can add and remove elements from a collection as needed, and it will automatically grow or shrink to accommodate the changes.
- Collections provide a range of useful methods, such as reversing the order of elements, that can make it easier to manipulate the collection without needing to know the underlying implementation details.
- Java also provides tools for converting between arrays and collections, which can be helpful when working with data in different formats.
